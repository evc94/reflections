When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

    When i'll have to work on another station or with another people.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    Maybe i don't want to automatically stay up-to-date because i dont want
    to have these changes every time.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use
one instead of another?

    Only can fork in GitHub of one repository to one account.
    Clones can be done local and remote
    Branches work local doing commits on versions "exp"

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote
stored locally?

    That way, we have the chance if we dont have the last know on other devices
    to pull that.

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would be easier, and
what would be harder?

    The easier part it's that I can do some changes to de project if i just made
    a copy. But the harder part its collaborate and merge the project if that is
    many content.

When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in
master? What benefits does each approach have?

    The chance to look the changes and think its right or not.

How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

    Viewing a diff between two version its more easier than check manually

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

    Seen a list of all the changes on a document

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

    I decide to save when its enough to do a commit, in version automatically
    saved every change would be a commit

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    It's important to save multiple files if the are doing part of work on the
    project

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

    typing git log and doing scroll down with the keyboard, to find some commits,
    to view the difference between two commits should use git diff whit the id
    of commits.

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

    If i did a mistake i can do a "checkout" to solve the problem and start
    again.

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

    Making code projects, web sites, mobil apps, for everything! better if i
    have to work with more people.
